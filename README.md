# a-Convolutional-Neural-Network-which-detects-Covid-19-
A clever Convolutional Neural Network systems to classify between COVID-19,Pneumonia and No-COVID-19 patients. This study proposes a machine Learning based classification of extracted deep feature using VGG16 model with COVID-19 and Pneumonia patients on Chest X-ray images. The model is achieving accuracy: 0.9900 and a loss of 0.0341
